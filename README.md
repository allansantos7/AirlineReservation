<h1>Airline Flight Reservation System</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
There will be two different flights the user may choose from.  Each flight will have a different seating arrangement.  Two flights will need to be graphically created, each with a different seating arrangement.

<h3>Goals:</h3>

There will be two different flights the user may choose from.  Each flight will have a different seating arrangement.  Two flights will need to be graphically created, each with a different seating arrangement.  How you do this is up to you.  An idea on how to do each flight would be to use a canvas filled with labels to represent the seats.

The “Choose Flight” combo box should be filled up with the two different flights that are extracted from the database Flight table.  In the combo box, both the Flight Number and Aircraft Type should be displayed.  When the form first loads, the flights should be extracted from the database and inserted into the combo box.  All other controls on the form should be disabled at this point.

            When the user selects a flight from the “Choose Flight” combo box two things should happen.  The first is that the appropriate flight should be displayed on the left of the program, and the second is that the “Choose Passenger” combo box should be enabled and loaded with the passengers on the selected flight from the database.

            The “Change Seat” and “Delete Passenger” buttons will not have any functionality for the first part of this assignment.

            When the user clicks the “Add Passenger” button another form should be displayed.  This form needs to be created for this part of the assignment.  The other form is where the new passenger’s information will be entered.  This form should allow the user to enter the passenger’s first name and last name.  It should also have a “Save” and “Cancel” button on it.  For the first part of this assignment both of these buttons will do nothing but close this form.
